# Eleos/Drive Axle Document Downloader

If you're just looking to download the script, you can [download the latest release](https://github.com/eleostech/document-downloader/releases). Instructions for configuring the script are available in the package.

If you prefer not to use the script, you can always use the REST documents API directly. For more information about the Eleos Document API, see the [Platform documentation.](https://dev.eleostech.com/platform/platform.html#tag/Documents)
